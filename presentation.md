### I will be exaggerating

---

# Sealed classes

### *Nihil novi*
Already exists in other languages. Also in Java.

### Mocking issues

### But still cool!

### Enumy taste

---

# Pattern matching

## Unlock the power of sealed classes

---

# Extension functions

```
  fun ExternalClass.missingFunction() {}
```

## Cool way to not die from external libs poisoning

## Very usefull for writing transformers/converts

---

# Top level

## We don't need no util classes

---

# Constructors and inits

## Fancy shmancy
 - primary 
 - secondary
 - 

---

# Operator overloading


---

# Scoped functions


---

# Tricky tricky nullability

## Using java classes

## Compiler is not perfect

## Bang bang!

---

# DSL
